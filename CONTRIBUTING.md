## Adding a new SPA

The wilder the prompts and apps are, the better :fire:

### :warning: Before you commit

Your code must be 100% ChatGPT generated. Since there aren't perfect methods of figuring out whether code was written by GPT, you're expected to include a screenshot of output from ChatGPT that includes the prompt you entered and the response back. If your monitor isn't vertical and you can't capture a screenshot of the prompt and output in one take, resize the page (<kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Mac) down low enough to capture it all. Your prompt must be in English, and cannot be a block of code that ChatGPT just repeats.

### Examples of reasons a PR would get rejected

- PR doesn't include single screenshot of prompt and output for each chunk of code included `(single-screenshot-per-chunk)`
- Prompt shown in screenshot contained all the code that ChatGPT "wrote" `(prompt-repeated-by-gpt)`
- SPA is explicit or too "bad" to add to repo (subject to contributor's definition of "bad") `(explicit-or-bad-faith)`
- SPA wasn't added to the file structure correctly (ie not in `/SPAs` or missing `index.html`) `(invalid-file-structure)`
- Files in locations other than `README.md` and `SPAs/{your SPA}` were touched in a PR that adds an SPA `(file-creep ðŸ‘€)`

Yes, this check isn't perfect. One could certainly modify a screenshot and add human written code to this codebase but that wouldn't be as interesting as letting GPT write everything here. So, I'm relying on the common good of others to keep this 100% GPT written :)

### 1. Fork the repo

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:HudsonGraeme/ChatGPT-Spa.git
```

### 2. Create a new folder in `SPAs` to house your code

Copy your code from GPT and paste it into a new folder below the `SPAs` directory. As long as prompts and output are screenshotted for each chunk of code, applications can be as complex or as simple as desired. The only requirement here is that the app can be accessed from a single `index.html` file at the root of your SPA's folder.

Your file structure should look like:

```none
README.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
index.html
SPAs/
    {Your SPA's name here} /
        index.html
        ...
```

### 3. Update the `README.md` with your SPA

Open the `README.md` and add a new table row to the "Table of SPAs". The row **must be inserted in alphabetical order** based on the `Name` column relative to the other SPAs in the list.

`README.md`

```md
...

## Table of SPAs

|       Name        | Description                                  |                                 Link                                  |
| :---------------: | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| {Your SPA's name} | {A brief (<200 word description of the SPA)} | https://chatgpt-spa.github.io/spas/{Your SPA's URI-encoded name here} |

...
```

### 4. Commit your changes

Ideally your commit messages should take on the following format

```none
({spa name})-{commit-message}
```

For example

```none
(myapp)-Add index.html
(myapp)-Update readme with new spa
```

### 5. Open a PR and include your screenshot(s)

Open up a PR and include screenshots of all the code generated by [ChatGPT] including the prompts! It will be reviewed and upon approval will be added ot the collection of awesome SPAs generated by AI!
